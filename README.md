This project is a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning classification task based on the Titanic dataset from Seaborn. It includes full preprocessing (handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling), exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training of two classification models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest. The goal is to predict passenger survival (survived) using various features such as age, fare, class, gender, and more.

Key steps in the project:

* Data cleaning with KNNImputer for missing values

* One-Hot Encoding for categorical features

* Feature scaling with StandardScaler

* Model comparison before and after hyperparameter tuning

* Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

* Feature importance analysis for the Random Forest model
